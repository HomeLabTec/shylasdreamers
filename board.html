          <h3>Willicia</h3>
          <p>Born and raised in urban Toledo, Ohio, raised by a single mother, Willicia decided early on that education and gainful employment were her tickets out of poverty. She graduated from Libbey High School and later obtained a Bachelor of Science, and Master of Science in nursing degrees from Lourdes University. In her pursuit of happiness, armed with the inspiration to create stability and generational wealth for her family, she became an entrepreneur. She is passionate about creating opportunities that facilitate growth and development and creating job opportunities in urban and rural communities. Her hobbies include spending time with family and cats Meew &amp; Kali, traveling to anywhere with a beach, playing chess, reading nonfiction, and writing songs.</p>

          <h3>Anthony</h3>
          <p>Born and raised in Findlay, Ohio, Anthony developed an early passion for technology that quickly grew beyond curiosity into hands-on experience. He graduated from Cory-Rawson High School while attending Millstream Career Center, where he began building a strong foundation in information technology and technical problem-solving. From an early age, Anthony immersed himself in computers and networking—teaching himself how systems work from the ground up. Over time, this grew into practical experience managing servers, designing networks, working with cybersecurity concepts, and building reliable, automated environments. He enjoys understanding not just how technology works, but why it works—and how to make it better, more efficient, and more resilient. Outside of formal work, Anthony is an avid builder and tinkerer. His hobbies include 3D printing, drone flying, PC building, automation, and video games, many of which overlap with his technical projects. Whether designing custom solutions, experimenting with new tools, or automating everyday tasks, he approaches everything with curiosity and a drive to continuously learn. Anthony values hands-on experience, self-education, and thoughtful problem-solving, and he is always looking for new ways to combine creativity with technology to build systems that are both functional and innovative.</p>
